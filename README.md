What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Learning object creation and the math related to it enabled me to somewhat recreate a scene that was taken from real life.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process follows, from my understanding, was an iterative approach. I would working on the same object each with with additional functionality being added to help familiarize myself with the OpenGL process of creating graphics.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Iteration helped me out tremendously, as smaller steps were taken to eventually reach the culmination of project finalization. Iteration will help ensure a thorough understanding of the project materials along with ensuring I don't overload myself with doing too much too soon.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Utilizing vectors and indices to maintain and draw objects was something new I encountered with this course. I also obtained better skills in storing information in multiple variable instances in order to draw out elements and arrays in a sequential order.

How did iteration factor into your development?
This was the first course that I can recall that really stressed iteration in the development cycle. As mentioned above, being able to take smaller steps in recreating my scene helped me out tremendously in not becoming overwhelmed in my understanding and implementation.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Despite still encountering struggles in this course, going through the milestone route to project completion instilled more of a compartmentalized learning and development process.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I gained a better understanding of how math and code can work together to create complex objects and scenes, which will assist me maintain a strong appreciation and understanding of how mathematics and code are interlinked and essential for future educational projects.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I gained much more appreciation for programmers that use OpenGL to recreate highly complex scenes. While I may not follow the same path professionally, I obtained even more confirmation that coding in this day and age can lead to limitless potential for solutions and creativity.
